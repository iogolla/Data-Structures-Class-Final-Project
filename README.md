# HaverQuest AI Adventure


In this project I'll be designing an AI implementation that solves a
tile-based squirrel game. To present a clear process of my implementation,
I will divide my explanation into two parts. 

![HaverQuest Gameplay](./gameplay.png)

"HaverQuest is a tile-based game, meaning that the game board is
represented as a grid composed of tiles. An individual tile can be
something like a piece of grass, a piece of a wall, etc... A map is a
big matrix of tiles with various properties: grass, walls, and so
on. HaverQuest allows maps to be loaded in a format specified by its
game engine. For example, the above map is represented as a file like
this:

```
# HaverQuest Map Level 1
# G -- Grass
# B -- Grey brick
# R -- Red brick
GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
GGGGGGGGGGRRRRRRRGGG
GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
BBBBBGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
GGGRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
GGGRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
GGGRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
GGGRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
GGGRGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
```

The lines that start with `#` are comments, and are ignored by
HaverQuest's engine as it loads the map. The map is comprised of an
n-by-k matrix of characters, where each character stands in for the
name of an image. This configuration is also possible to change in a
file named `config.json`, which specifies the properties of various
tiles.

On top of the map sits various other tiles. For example, there's a
squirrel (the game's main character that you can move with the up,
down, left, and right keys) along with a nut. The goal of the game is
to get to the nut before running out of "fuel." You lose one fuel each
time you make a move (either up, down, left, or right).


### Setting up HaverQuest

To run HaverQuest, you'll need to have the `pygame` module
installed. To do this, please run the following command on your
computer (reach out to me if this doesn't work):

    pip3 install pygame

HaverQuest uses `pygame` to perform the work of rendering graphics to
the screen.

You should then be able to run HaverQuest by using the following
command:

    python3 game.py

You should then see the empty game board set up, allowing you to play
the game." - ![Kris Micinski] (http://kmicinski.com/)


## Part 1: Getting to the Health Pack

This part will make the squirrel move to the health pack for the
purpose of building up more fuel. To make the squirrel move to the health pack, 
I will use the `Path Finder` class to develop a pathfinder solution. I will 
integrate its `findPath` method in my solution to make the squirrel 
move from the starting cordinate all the way to the health pack.

The methods I need to implement for this part are:

- (1) `getFuel(self)`, which reports the level of the fuel left
- (2) `move(self,x,y)`,  which accepts x and y in the range [-1,1] and 
moves to that tile using |x| + |y| fuel
- (3) `getHealthPacks(self)`, which gets the position of the healthpacks 
on the board 

In addition to these methods, I will add a field called `self.healthPack` 
to `MyAISquirrel` and set it to **None** then I will assign 
`getHealthPacks(self)` method to it so as to avoid losing 20 fuel each clocktick.
Before the first clocktick is called, I will make the squirrel move to the 
healthpack along the path generated by the `findPath` method from PathFinder class




## Part 2: Getting to the Exit Position

In this part, I will construct an AI that moves the squirrel from its 
current position all the way to the exit position while firing stones 
at the ferrets. This part will make the squirrel wait until the fuel builds up to 60 
before it makes any movement. The intention is to make it gather enough fuel so that 
it can be able to self-sustain itself through the exit without losing fuel whenever 
it gets hit by a stone fired by the ferrets. Initially, the squirrel will move horizontally
toward the left without firing a single stone but once it starts moving vertically, 
it will start firing stones up and diagonally toward the northwest direction
in attempt to kill the ferrets. 

The methods I need to implement for this part are:

- (1) `getExit(self)`, which reports the position of the exit tile
- (2) `move(self,x,y),  which accepts x and y in the range [-1,1] and 
moves to that tile using |x| + |y| fuel
- (3) `fireStone(self,x,y`, which fires a stone with a set speed along
the vector (x * speed, y * speed). You don't have any control over speed, 
but x and y must be in the range [-1,1]

In addition to these methods, I will add a field called `self.exitPosition` 
to `MyAISquirrel` and set it to **None** then I will assign 
`getExit(self)` method to it so as to avoid losing 30 fuel each clocktick
